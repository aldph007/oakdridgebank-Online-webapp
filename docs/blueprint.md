## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark navy blue (#1A237E) to convey trust and security, drawing directly from the brand color in the image.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F5F5F5) to create a clean and professional backdrop that allows content to stand out, complementing the navy blue.
- Accent color: A muted purple (#9FA8DA), which is analogous to navy blue. Using this provides subtle contrast on interactive elements.
- Font pairing: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text to maintain a modern, readable feel and 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines to provide a technical edge. 'Space Grotesk' offers an elegant appearance for key headers, aligning with financial applications.
- Use a set of consistent, professional line icons for navigation and actions. They should complement the dark navy blue color scheme and maintain clarity across different screen sizes.
- Implement a card-based layout for displaying financial information, similar to the design of the original image. Ensure all the information is presented clearly, legibly, and intuitively. Use white space effectively to avoid clutter and maintain a sense of order.
- Use subtle transition effects and animations to improve user experience, but minimize distraction. For instance, apply a gentle fade-in effect when loading new data or display transaction confirmations via slide-in notifications.
